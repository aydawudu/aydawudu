👋 Hi, I’m Asabe (A-sa-bey)
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate data scientist with a strong interest in applying cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems. Here's a little more about me:

👀 What I'm Interested In
I’m deeply fascinated by the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data Analytics, and other emerging technologies to drive innovation and efficiency across industries. Specifically, my interests include:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): I’ve worked on projects involving unstructured data classification, helping businesses extract valuable insights from large datasets of text.
Fraud Detection: I’m currently developing machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, leveraging big data to ensure accuracy and scalability.
AI-Powered Applications: From chatbots to recommendation systems, I’m exploring how AI can transform user experiences and optimize business processes.
Cloud Technologies: With hands-on experience in AWS and Azure, I build scalable, cloud-based machine learning solutions to meet enterprise needs.
💡 About Me
I bring over a decade of experience in Data Science, having led and contributed to various projects across industries like aviation, healthcare, and finance. My journey includes:

Director of Data Science at a leading airline, where I developed data-driven solutions that enhanced operational efficiency and reduced costs.
Applying NLP algorithms to optimize processes and reduce failures in aircraft maintenance systems.
Cloud Certified: I hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and have 2+ years of experience with Azure.
Doctorate Degree: I recently earned my Doctorate from the University of the Cumberlands, further deepening my expertise in AI and ML.
I’m currently learning how to build state-of-the-art applications with LangChain, Pinecone, and Python to further my knowledge of LLMs (Large Language Models).

💞️ Collaboration Opportunities
I’m always looking to collaborate on data science projects, especially those focused on:

AI-driven solutions that help businesses transform their operations.
Fraud detection systems or predictive modeling to enhance security.
Natural Language Processing to unlock the potential of unstructured data.
